# Design
The forum design brings back the nostalgic feel of Old School RuneScape with warm colors and classic images. It's like a visual tribute to the game's enduring charm, making discussions on quests, skilling, and combat more enjoyable for users.

## Logo

The logo mimics the classic OSRS logo with the sword in between the text.
<br>
The Logo was created with the help of [Looka](https://looka.com/onboarding)

![Logo](README_files/logo.png)

## Fonts

The site uses Roboto Slab for headings and Roboto for paragraphs. These fonts blend perfectly with the Old School RuneScape theme and create a distinct difference between headings and paragraphs.

![Fonts](README_files/font.JPG)

## Background

The background image gives the user the classic, nostalgic Old School RuneScape vibe, transporting users back to the old days of the game.

![Background](README_files/background.JPG)

## Color

The color palette, with its earthy tones and warm colors, makes the forum look inviting and put together. It finds a nice balance between being easy to read and looking good, making the user experience better overall.
<br>
This color palette was created with the help of [Coolors.](https://coolors.co/)

![Color Palette image](README_files/color-palette.JPG)

## Wireframes

This wireframe is a simple layout sketch used in the early design stages to plan the structure and key elements of the forum. It provides a visual guide without delving into specific details, aiding in the initial planning of the design.
<br>
This wireframe was created with the help of [Balsamiq.](https://balsamiq.com/)

<details><summary>Home page</summary>
<img src="README_files/home_page.JPG">
</details>
<details><summary>Landing/About page</summary>
<img src="README_files/about_page.JPG">
</details>
<details><summary>Log In page</summary>
<img src="README_files/login_page.JPG">
</details>
<details><summary>Create/Edit Post page</summary>
<img src="README_files/create_post_page.JPG">
</details>
<details><summary>Post Details page</summary>
<img src="README_files/post_detail_page.JPG">
</details>

During development, the designs have evolved and changed due to testing and user feedback. As a result, the final implementation may vary from these initial wireframes.

# Database

Mapping out the database structure before coding is crucial for organizing information, reducing errors, and improving efficiency. That is why a simple Database schema was made before the start of development.
<br>
For the database, a relational database[(ElephantSQL)](https://customer.elephantsql.com/instance) was employed, utilizing tables and keys to maintain an organized dataset.
<br>
This database schema was created with the help of [dbdiagram.io.](https://dbdiagram.io/home)

![Database Schema image](README_files/database.JPG)

### Agile Project Management with GitHub Projects

To make managing projects easier, we use GitHub Projects as a central hub. User stories and tasks are like organized to-do lists, and the GitHub project board shows progress visually.

### User Stories as GitHub Issues

Turning user stories into GitHub issues helps organize user-focused features. These issues are linked to their corresponding user stories, making it easier to access criteria, tasks, and discussions.

### Bug Tracking for Seamless Development

We document bugs found during development as GitHub issues. This provides details on each bug's characteristics, impact, and how to reproduce it. By adding links to these issues in README.md, users can stay informed about bug fixes and share their thoughts.


### User Story Distribution (MoSCoW)

For this project, MoSCoW was used for the userstories to prioritizes implementation of features. MoSCoW is a project management framework that prioritizes requirements into four categories: Must-haves (critical for success), Should-haves (important), Could-haves (desirable if resources permit), and Won't-haves (explicitly excluded or deferred).
