# Design

text

## Design Choices

## Fonts

The site uses Roboto Slab for headings and Roboto for paragraphs. These fonts blend perfectly with the Old School RuneScape theme and create a distinct difference between headings and paragraphs.

![Fonts](README_files/font.JPG)

## Background

The background image gives the user that clasic nostalgic Old School Runescape feeling from the old days.

![Background](README_files/background.JPG)

## Color

The color palette, with its earthy tones and warm colors, makes the forum look inviting and put together. It finds a nice balance between being easy to read and looking good, making the user experience better overall.
